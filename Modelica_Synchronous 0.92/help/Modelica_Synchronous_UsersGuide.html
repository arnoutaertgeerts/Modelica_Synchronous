>Modelica_Synchronous.UsersGuide</a>.Clocks</h2>

<p>
A central element of the Modelica_Synchronous library is a <b>clock</b>.
Below, the most important information for clocks is summarized.
For more details, see the Modelica Language Specification,
Chapter 16 (for Modelica Language Version &ge; 3.3).
</p>

<p>
A <b>Clock</b> type is a base data type (introduced in Modelica 3.3, additionally to Real, Integer, Boolean, String) that defines when a particular partition consisting of a set of equations is active. Starting with Modelica Language Version 3.3, every variable and every equation is either continuous-time or is associated exactly to one clock. This feature is visualized in the figure below where c(ti) is a clock that is active at particular time instants ti and r(ti) is a variable that is associated to this clock. A clocked variable has only a value when the corresponding clock is active:
</p>

<p>
<img src="../Resources/Images/Clocks/clockSignals.png">
</p>

<p>
Similarly to RealInput, RealOutput etc., clock input and output connectors, called ClockInput and ClockOutput, are defined in sublibrary
<a href="Modelica_Synchronous_ClockSignals_Interfaces.html#Modelica_Synchronous.ClockSignals.Interfaces"
>ClockSignal.Interfaces</a>
in order to propagate clocks via connections. A clock signal can be generated with
one of the blocks of sublibrary
<a href="Modelica_Synchronous_ClockSignals_Clocks.html#Modelica_Synchronous.ClockSignals.Clocks"
>ClockSignals.Clocks</a>:
</p>

<p>
<img src="../Resources/Images/Clocks/clocks.png">
</p>

<p>
The output signals of the blocks in the above figure are clock signals,
by default visualized with dotted grey lines.
</p>

<p>
With the blocks of sublibrary
<a href="Modelica_Synchronous_ClockSignals_Sampler.html#Modelica_Synchronous.ClockSignals.Sampler"
>ClockSignals.Sampler</a>
a clock signal can be sub-sampled, super-sampled, or shift-sampled to generate
a new clock signal. For example, with the following model, a periodic clock signal of 0.1 s
is sub-sampled with a factor 3 and therefore a clock signal with a period of 0.3 s
is generated:
</p>

<p>
<img src="../Resources/Images/Clocks/subSampledClockExample.png"><br>
<img src="../Resources/Images/Clocks/subSampledClockResult.png">
</p>

<p>
As usual in synchronous languages, a clock is represented by a <b>true</b> value
when the clock is active. The relationship between such derived
clocks is <b>exact</b>, so it is guaranteed that at every 3rd tick of clock
"periodicRealClock.y", the clock "subSample.y" is active.
</p>

<p>
If a clock is associated to a clocked continuous-time partition, then an <b>integrator</b>
has to be defined that is used to integrate the partition from the previous
to the current clock tick. This is performed by setting parameter <b>useSolver</b>
= <b>true</b> and defining the integration method as String with
parameter <b>solver</b>. Both parameters are in tab <b>Advanced</b>
of one of the clock signal generating blocks.
The possible integration methods are tool dependent. It is expected that
at least the solvers "External" (= use the integrator selected in the
simulation environment) and "ExplicitEuler" (= explicit Euler method)
are supported by every tool. For an example, see
<a href="Modelica_Synchronous_Examples_Systems.html#Modelica_Synchronous.Examples.Systems.ControlledMixingUnit"
>Examples.Systems.ControlledMixingUnit</a>.
</p>

<p>
A clocked partition is a set of equations that depend
on each other and where the boundary variables are marked
with sample and hold operators.
If a clocked partition contains no operator <b>der</b>, <b>delay</b>,
<b>spatialDistribution</b>, no event related operators (with exception of <b>noEvent</b>(..)),
and no <b>when</b>-clause with a Boolean condition, it is a <b>clocked discrete-time</b>
partition, that is, it is a standard sampled data system that is described by difference equations.
If a clocked partition is <b>not</b> a <b>clocked discrete-time</b> partition and
it contains neither operator <b>previous</b> nor operator
<b>interval</b>, it is a
<b>clocked discretized continuous-time</b> partition.
Such a partition has to be solved with a <b>solver</b> method.
It is an error, if none of the two properties hold, e.g., if operators
<b>previous</b> and <b>der</b> are both used in the same partition.
In a clocked discrete-time partition all event generating mechanisms
do no longer apply. Especially neither relations, nor one of the built-in event
triggering operators will trigger an event.

The synchronous Modelica language elements allow for the first
time to utilize a continuous-time, nonlinear, inverse model in
a Modelica sampled-data system, by automatically discretizing
this model and providing it as a clocked partition. This allows
a convenient definition of certain nonlinear control systems,
see example
<a href="Modelica_Synchronous_Examples_Systems.html#Modelica_Synchronous.Examples.Systems.ControlledMixingUnit"
>Examples.Systems.ControlledMixingUnit</a>.
Several practical details to use nonlinear inverse plant models in
a control system are discussed in the following reference:</i>

The synchronous Modelica language elements used in this library
are based on the clock calculus and inference system proposed by (Colaco and
Pouzet 2003) and implemented in Lucid Synchrone version 2 and 3 (Pouzet 2006).
However, the Modelica approach also uses multi-rate periodic clocks based on
rational arithmetic introduced by (Forget et. al. 2008), as an extension of
the Lucid Synchrone semantics. These approaches belong to the class of
synchronous languages (Benveniste et. al. 2002):</i>

as furnished by the Licensor, for the duration of the patents,
to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and import the Original Work
and Derivative Works under the conditions as given in Section 2.
For the matter of clarity, the license regarding Derivative Works covers
patent claims to the extent as they are embodied in the Original Work only.</p>

<p>
<b>6. Provision of Source Code.</b> Licensor agrees to provide
You with a copy of the Source Code of the Original Work but reserves
the right to decide freely on the manner of how the Original Work is
provided.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the matter of clarity, Licensor might provide only a binary
representation of the Original Work. In that case, You may (a) either
reproduce the Source Code from the binary representation if this is
possible (e.g., by performing a copy of an encrypted Modelica
package, if encryption allows the copy operation) or (b) request the
Source Code from the Licensor who will provide it to You.</p>

<p>
<b>7. Exclusions from License Grant.</b> Neither the names of
Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor
any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or
promote products derived from this Original Work without express
prior permission of the Licensor. Except as otherwise expressly
stated in this License and in particular in Sections 2 and 5, nothing
in this License grants any license to Licensor&rsquo;s trademarks,
copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual
property, and no patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer
for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent claims.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No license is granted to the trademarks of
Licensor even if such trademarks are included in the Original Work,
except as expressly stated in this License. Nothing in this License
shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under terms
different from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise
would have a right to license.</p>

<p>
<b>8. Attribution Rights.</b> You must retain in the Source
Code of the Original Work and of any Derivative Works that You
create, all author, copyright, patent, or trademark notices, as well
as any descriptive text identified therein as an &quot;Attribution
Notice&quot;. The same applies to the licensing notice of this
License in the Original Work. For the matter of clarity, &ldquo;author
notice&rdquo; means the notice that identifies the original
author(s). <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative
Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice
reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the
Original Work. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case the Original Work or Derivative Work is not provided in
Source Code, the Attribution Notices shall be appropriately
displayed, e.g., in the documentation of the Derivative Work.</p>

Frequently Asked Questions</h5>
<p>This
section contains questions/answer to users and/or distributors of
Modelica packages and/or documents under Modelica License 2. Note,
the answers to the questions below are not a legal interpretation of
the Modelica License 2. In case of a conflict, the language of the
license shall prevail.</p>

<h6>Using or Distributing a Modelica <u>Package</u> under the Modelica License 2</h6>

<p><b>What are the main
differences to the previous version of the Modelica License?</b></p>
<ol>
  <li><p>
  Modelica License 1 is unclear whether the licensed Modelica package
  can be distributed under a different license. Version 2 explicitly
  allows that &ldquo;Derivative Work&rdquo; can be distributed under
  any license of Your choice, see examples in Section 1d) as to what
  qualifies as Derivative Work (so, version 2 is clearer).</p>
  <li><p>
  If You modify a Modelica package under Modelica License 2 (besides
  fixing of errors, adding vendor specific Modelica annotations, using
  a subset of the classes of a Modelica package, or using another
  representation, e.g., a binary representation), you must rename the
  root-level name of the package for your distribution. In version 1
  you could keep the name (so, version 2 is more restrictive). The
  reason of this restriction is to reduce the risk that Modelica
  packages are available that have identical names, but different
  functionality.</p>
  <li><p>
  Modelica License 1 states that &ldquo;It is not allowed to charge a
  fee for the original version or a modified version of the software,
  besides a reasonable fee for distribution and support&rdquo;.
  Version 2 has a similar intention for all Original Work under
  <u>Modelica License 2</u> (to remain free of charge and open source)
  but states this more clearly as &ldquo;No fee, neither as a
  copyright-license fee, nor as a selling fee for the copy as such may
  be charged&rdquo;. Contrary to version 1, Modelica License 2 has no
  restrictions on fees for Derivative Work that is provided under a
  different license (so, version 2 is clearer and has fewer
  restrictions).</p>
  <li><p>
  Modelica License 2 introduces several useful provisions for the
  licensee (articles 5, 6, 12), and for the licensor (articles 7, 12,
  13, 14) that have no counter part in version 1.</p>
  <li><p>
  Modelica License 2 can be applied to all type of work, including
  documents, images and data files, contrary to version 1 that was
  dedicated for software only (so, version 2 is more general).</p>
</ol>

<p><b>Can I distribute a
Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) as part of my commercial
Modelica modeling and simulation environment?</b></p>
<p>Yes,
according to Section 2c). However, you are not allowed to charge a
fee for this part of your environment. Of course, you can charge for
your part of the environment.
</p>

<p><b>Can I distribute a
Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) under a different
license?</b></p>
<p>No.
The license of an unmodified Modelica package cannot be changed
according to Sections 2c) and 2d). This means that you cannot <u>sell</u>
copies of it, any distribution has to be free of charge.</p>

<p><b>Can I distribute a
Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) under a different license
when I first encrypt the package?</b></p>
<p>No.
Merely encrypting a package does not qualify for Derivative Work and
therefore the encrypted package has to stay under Modelica License 2.</p>

<p><b>Can I distribute a
Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) under a different license
when I first add classes to the package?</b></p>
<p>No.
The package itself remains unmodified, i.e., it is Original Work, and
therefore the license for this part must remain under Modelica
License 2. The newly added classes can be, however, under a different
license.
</p>

<p><b>Can
I copy a class out of a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2)
and include it </b><u><b>unmodified</b></u><b> in a Modelica package
under a </b><u><b>commercial/proprietary license</b></u><b>?</b></p>
<p>No,
according to article 2c). However, you can include model, block,
function, package, record and connector classes in your Modelica
package under <u>Modelica License 2</u>. This means that your
Modelica package could be under a commercial/proprietary license, but
one or more classes of it are under Modelica License 2.<br>Note, a
&ldquo;type&rdquo; class (e.g., type Angle = Real(unit=&rdquo;rad&rdquo;))
can be copied and included unmodified under a commercial/proprietary
license (for details, see the next question).</p>

<p><b>Can
I copy a type class or </b><u><b>part</b></u><b> of a model, block,
function, record, connector class, out of a Modelica package (under
Modelica License 2) and include it modified or unmodified in a
Modelica package under a </b><u><b>commercial/proprietary</b></u><b>
license</b></p>
<p>Yes,
according to article 2d), since this will in the end usually qualify
as Derivative Work. The reasoning is the following: A type class or
part of another class (e.g., an equation, a declaration, part of a
class description) cannot be utilized &ldquo;by its own&rdquo;. In
order to make this &ldquo;usable&rdquo;, you have to add additional
code in order that the class can be utilized. This is therefore
usually Derivative Work and Derivative Work can be provided under a
different license. Note, this only holds, if the additional code
introduced is sufficient to qualify for Derivative Work. Merely, just
copying a class and changing, say, one character in the documentation
of this class would be no Derivative Work and therefore the copied
code would have to stay under Modelica License 2.</p>

<p><b>Can
I copy a class out of a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2)
and include it in </b><u><b>modified </b></u><b>form in a
</b><u><b>commercial/proprietary</b></u><b> Modelica package?</b></p>
<p>Yes.
If the modification can be seen as a &ldquo;Derivative Work&rdquo;,
you can place it under your commercial/proprietary license. If the
modification does not qualify as &ldquo;Derivative Work&rdquo; (e.g.,
bug fixes, vendor specific annotations), it must remain under
Modelica License 2. This means that your Modelica package could be
under a commercial/proprietary license, but one or more parts of it
are under Modelica License 2.</p>

<p><b>Can I distribute a
&ldquo;save total model&rdquo; under my commercial/proprietary
license, even if classes under Modelica License 2 are included?</b></p>
<p>Your
classes of the &ldquo;save total model&rdquo; can be distributed
under your commercial/proprietary license, but the classes under
Modelica License 2 must remain under Modelica License 2. This means
you can distribute a &ldquo;save total model&rdquo;, but some parts
might be under Modelica License 2.</p>

<p><b>Can I distribute a
Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) in encrypted form?</b></p>
<p>Yes.
Note, if the encryption does not allow &ldquo;copying&rdquo; of
classes (in to unencrypted Modelica source code), you have to send
the Modelica source code of this package to your customer, if he/she
wishes it, according to article&nbsp;6.</p>

<p><b>Can I distribute an
executable under my commercial/proprietary license, if the model from
which the executable is generated uses models from a Modelica package
under Modelica License 2?</b></p>
<p>Yes,
according to article 2d), since this is seen as Derivative Work. The
reasoning is the following: An executable allows the simulation of a
concrete model, whereas models from a Modelica package (without
pre-processing, translation, tool run-time library) are not able to
be simulated without tool support. By the processing of the tool and
by its run-time libraries, significant new functionality is added (a
model can be simulated whereas previously it could not be simulated)
and functionality available in the package is removed (e.g., to build
up a new model by dragging components of the package is no longer
possible with the executable).</p>

<p><b>Is my modification to
a Modelica package (under Modelica License 2) a Derivative Work?</b></p>
<p>It
is not possible to give a general answer to it. To be regarded as &quot;an
original work of authorship&quot;, a derivative work must be
different enough from the original or must contain a substantial
amount of new material. Making minor changes or additions of little
substance to a preexisting work will not qualify the work as a new
version for such purposes.
</p>

<h6>Using or Distributing a Modelica <u>Document</u> under the Modelica License 2</h6>

<p>This
section is devoted especially for the following applications:</p>
<ol type="a">
  <li><p>
  A Modelica tool extracts information out of a Modelica package and
  presents the result in form of a &ldquo;manual&rdquo; for this
  package in, e.g., html, doc, or pdf format.</p>
  <li><p>
  The Modelica language specification is a document defining the
  Modelica language. It will be licensed under Modelica License 2.</p>
  <li><p>
  Someone writes a book about the Modelica language and/or Modelica
  packages and uses information which is available in the Modelica
  language specification and/or the corresponding Modelica package.</p>
</ol>

<p><b>Can I sell a manual
that was basically derived by extracting information automatically
from a Modelica package under Modelica License 2 (e.g., a &ldquo;reference
guide&rdquo; of the Modelica Standard Library):</b></p>
<p>Yes.
Extracting information from a Modelica package, and providing it in a
human readable, suitable format, like html, doc or pdf format, where
the content is significantly modified (e.g. tables with interface
information are constructed from the declarations of the public
variables) qualifies as Derivative Work and there are no restrictions
to charge a fee for Derivative Work under alternative 2d).</p>

<p><b>Can
I copy a text passage out of a Modelica document (under Modelica
License 2) and use it </b><u><b>unmodified</b></u><b> in my document
(e.g. the Modelica syntax description in the Modelica Specification)?</b></p>
<p>Yes.
In case you distribute your document, the copied parts are still
under Modelica License 2 and you are not allowed to charge a license
fee for this part. You can, of course, charge a fee for the rest of
your document.</p>

<p><b>Can
I copy a text passage out of a Modelica document (under Modelica
License 2) and use it in </b><u><b>modified</b></u><b> form in my
document?</b></p>
<p>Yes,
the creation of Derivative Works is allowed. In case the content is
significantly modified this qualifies as Derivative Work and there
are no restrictions to charge a fee for Derivative Work under
alternative 2d).</p>

<p><b>Can I sell a printed
version of a Modelica document (under Modelica License 2), e.g., the
Modelica Language Specification?</b></p>
<p>No,
if you are not the copyright-holder, since article 2c) does not allow
a selling fee for a (in this case physical) copy. However, mere
printing and shipping costs may be recovered.</p>

This library is basically a graphical user interface to conveniently
operate with the Modelica 3.3 language elements of Chapter 16
"Synchronous Language Elements" of the Modelica Language Specification 3.3.
Every tool that supports these language
elements, as well as basic language elements of Modelica 3.1, should be
able to support this library.
